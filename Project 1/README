The src folder contains all java files and the test folder contains all JUnit test cases for the java files.

Also, I am using eclipse and therefore have the input values for the input filename and output filename as arg[0] and arg[1].
I am not sure if this will cause you a problem, but if you receive an outofbounds error, you will have to switch to arg[0] and arg[1] to arg[2] 
arg[3] respectively in the SearchMap file. I did not run my program through command line, but rather modified my run configurations to include to arguments

.git and .gitignore will be contained in my zip folder or on my GitHub repository.
Because Eclipse already creates a .gitignore file, I was unable to create one within my directory.
Therefore I create a .gitignore on my GitHub repository and within the zip folder you will also be able to find the .git folder
